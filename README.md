**Brief summary (3-5 sentences) describing what you learned about Jenkins navigation**
while wrking with jenkins I learn about how to create the pipelines and monitor the job and access the bulid history, logs, and view staging
Adding new stage was so easy, and I was able to confirm its execution in the console logs and stage view whether the code is failed or successfull and help understanding the how jenkins automates tasks and maintain the bulid 
and showing the changes acrossly
